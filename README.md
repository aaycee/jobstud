JobStud project

This JobsStud project is supposed to be a user-friendly site that allows students to find oddjobs within their area and earn quick money. Anybody in fact, can find jobs and earn money using the site. Has something like this been developed already? Maybe! But this is just me trying to code something everyday until lent is over.
